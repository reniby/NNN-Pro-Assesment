# NNN Pro Assesment

This repo contains 2 Nest.js apps. 

To run either app, navigate to `monorepo/app1` or `monorepo/app2` and then run `npm run dev`

The app can then be viewed at `http://localhost:3000/`

You will see one list of names under the heading `Server-side List of Names` which is generated using person.getAll() directly

If you click the button, another list of names will be generated by hitting the API endpoint at the apps respective route.js
(ex: `app1/app/api/route.js`)
